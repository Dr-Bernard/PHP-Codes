<?php /* MyCalculator app had some defects and was fixed with StdCalculator app. The defects include:

Here's a critique of the MyCalculator codes:

Security vulnerabilities:

The code uses GET method for form submission, which exposes sensitive data in the URL. For calculations, POST method would be more appropriate.
There's no input validation or sanitization, making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks and potential SQL injection if the data is later used in database operations.


Accessibility issues:

The form lacks labels for input fields, making it difficult for screen readers to interpret.
There's no explanation of what the form does or what kind of numbers should be entered.


HTML structure:

The <title> tag contains a generic "Document" title, which is not descriptive or helpful for SEO or user experience.
There's no semantic structure (e.g., <header>, <main>, <footer>).


PHP code:

The PHP code is directly embedded in the HTML, which is not a best practice for separating concerns.
There's no error handling for cases where the form hasn't been submitted yet or when non-numeric values are entered.

Styling:
There's no CSS applied, resulting in a very basic and potentially unappealing user interface.

Functionality:
The calculator only performs addition. It lacks options for other operations like subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Code organization:
The PHP logic is mixed with the HTML output, which can lead to maintenance issues as the application grows.

Performance:
While not a significant issue for this simple example, using separate files for HTML and PHP would allow for better caching strategies.
